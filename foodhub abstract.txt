EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================

FoodHub is a full-stack web application designed for modern restaurant 
operations in India. It combines intelligent table reservation management with 
online food ordering capabilities, featuring advanced business logic including 
overlap-based capacity management, mandatory advance booking, and Indian 
Standard Time validation. The system automates customer communications through 
email confirmations and provides restaurant administrators with a centralized 
dashboard for operations management.

================================================================================

CORE OBJECTIVES
===============

1. Eliminate Overbooking
   - Intelligent 10-table capacity management with 2-hour dining duration 
     overlap detection

2. Enforce Advance Planning
   - Mandatory 2-hour minimum booking window prevents walk-ins, enabling 
     better kitchen preparation

3. Localized Operations
   - All time validations based on Indian Standard Time (IST) regardless of 
     server location

4. Dual-Purpose Platform
   - Single system handles both dine-in reservations and online ordering 
     (delivery/takeaway)

5. Automated Communication
   - Instant HTML email confirmations reduce customer inquiries and no-shows

6. Scalable Architecture
   - API-ready design supports future mobile app integration and multi-location 
     expansion

================================================================================

FEATURE BREAKDOWN
=================

1. SMART TABLE RESERVATION SYSTEM
   
   Advance Booking Logic:
   - Minimum Notice: 2 hours (configurable)
   - Maximum Notice: Unlimited (supports events months/years ahead)
   - Validation: Real-time IST comparison prevents past bookings
   - Error Messaging: Shows earliest available booking time

   Capacity Management:
   - Total Capacity: 10 physical tables
   - Dining Duration: 2 hours per reservation
   - Overlap Detection: Checks ±2 hour windows
   - Example: 8 bookings at 6:00 PM + 2 bookings at 7:00 PM = Full 
     (10/10 tables occupied 7:00-8:00 PM)
   - Intelligent Availability: Allows bookings 2+ hours apart when tables 
     free up

   Time Zone Handling:
   - Primary: Indian Standard Time (UTC+5:30)
   - Server Agnostic: Works correctly regardless of hosting location
   - Display Format: IST with Indian locale (dd/mm/yyyy, 12-hour format)

2. ONLINE ORDERING SYSTEM

   Order Types:
   - Delivery: Full address collection + optional Google Maps link
   - Takeaway: Minimal info, pickup at restaurant

   Menu Management (12 Pre-configured Items):
   - Starters: Paneer Tikka (₹220), Chicken Kebab (₹260), Samosa (₹50)
   - Main Course: Biryani (₹360), Butter Chicken (₹320), 
     Paneer Butter Masala (₹280), Dal Tadka (₹180)
   - Side Dishes: Naan (₹40), Veg Cutlet (₹120), Raita (₹90)
   - Desserts: Gulab Jamun (₹90), Lassi (₹80)
   - Category Filters: All Items, Starters, Main Course, Side Dishes, Desserts
   - Selection Interface: Checkboxes with quantity inputs (1-10)

   Address Collection (Delivery):
   - House/Flat Number (required)
   - Street/Area (required)
   - Landmark (optional)
   - City (required)
   - State (required)
   - Pincode (required, 6-digit validation)
   - Google Maps Link (optional) - Customer can share location

3. EMAIL NOTIFICATION SYSTEM

   Confirmation Emails:
   - Trigger: Sent immediately upon successful booking
   - Format: Professional HTML template with branding
   - Content:
     * Reservation ID (unique identifier)
     * Customer details (name, email, phone)
     * Booking details (date, time, party size)
     * Occasion and meal type
     * Payment mode (Cash/Online) and status
     * For Delivery/Takeaway:
       - Selected menu items with quantities and prices
       - Complete delivery address
       - Google Maps link (if provided)

   Technical Implementation:
   - Service: Gmail SMTP via Nodemailer
   - Credentials: Stored in .env (EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS)
   - Reliability: Error handling with fallback messaging

4. ADMIN DASHBOARD

   Features:
   - View All Reservations: Paginated list with filters
   - Status Management: Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled
   - Payment Tracking: Cash vs Online payment modes
   - Secure Access: API key authentication (ADMIN_API_KEY)
   - Real-time Data: Direct SQLite database queries

BUSINESS LOGIC & VALIDATION
============================

Multi-Layer Validation Pipeline:

1. Field Validation
   ✅ Required fields: name, email, phone, date, time, people, meal_type, 
      payment_mode
   ✅ Delivery-specific: delivery_address (if delivery_option === 'Delivery')
   ✅ Format checks: Email regex, phone digits, date format

2. Time Validation (IST-based)
   Step 1: Get current IST time
   Step 2: Parse reservation date/time
   Step 3: Check if reservation < current IST → REJECT (past booking)
   Step 4: Calculate minimum booking time (current IST + 2 hours)
   Step 5: Check if reservation < minimum → REJECT (insufficient advance)
   Step 6: ACCEPT if future + 2+ hours advance

3. Table Availability Check (Dine-in only)
   Step 1: Query all dine-in reservations for same date (non-cancelled)
   Step 2: Convert all times to minutes since midnight
   Step 3: For each existing reservation:
           Calculate time difference from requested time
           If difference < 120 minutes → Count as overlapping
   Step 4: If overlapping_count >= 10 → REJECT (tables full)
   Step 5: ACCEPT if < 10 tables occupied

Error Messages (User-Facing):
------------------------------
- Past Booking: "Cannot book a reservation in the past. Please select a 
  future date and time (Indian Standard Time)."
  
- Insufficient Advance: "Advance booking required. Please book at least 2 
  hours in advance. Earliest available time: [IST timestamp]"
  
- Tables Full: "Sorry, all tables are occupied around [time] on [date]. 
  Please choose a different time slot (at least 2 hours apart from existing 
  bookings)."
  
- Missing Fields: "Missing required fields." / "Delivery address is required 
  for delivery orders."

================================================================================

KEY DIFFERENTIATORS
===================

1. Overlap-Based Capacity (Not Per-Slot)
   Traditional Systems: Each time slot (6:00 PM, 7:00 PM) has independent 
   limits - Problem: Could book 10 tables at 6 PM + 10 at 7 PM = 20 tables 
   needed
   
   FoodHub Approach: Considers 2-hour dining duration with overlap detection
   - Solution: 10 bookings at 6 PM occupy tables until 8 PM, blocking 
     7:00-7:59 PM slots

2. Mandatory Advance Booking
   Benefit: No walk-in reservations ensures kitchen has 2+ hours notice for 
   preparation, inventory management, and staffing adjustments

3. IST-Aware Globally
   Challenge: Server hosted on Render (could be US/Europe) but restaurant 
   in India
   Solution: All time calculations explicitly use IST, ensuring accurate 
   validation regardless of server timezone

4. Unlimited Future Bookings
   Use Case: Customer can book birthday party 6 months ahead, wedding 
   anniversary 1 year ahead
   Implementation: No maximum date limit, only minimum 2-hour advance 
   requirement

5. Dual-Purpose Platform
   Efficiency: Single codebase handles both reservation (capacity-limited) 
   and ordering (unlimited) use cases with conditional logic

3. Real-Time Dashboard: WebSocket updates for live table status
4. SMS Notifications: Twilio integration for order updates
5. Payment Gateway: Razorpay/Stripe integration for online payments
6. Mobile App: React Native app consuming existing API
7. GPS Tracking: Use delivery_lat/lng for driver navigation
8. Analytics Dashboard: Booking trends, peak hours, revenue tracking

================================================================================

REAL-WORLD USE CASES
====================

Scenario 1: Family Birthday Dinner
- Customer books 2 months ahead for 8 people
- System accepts (future date, 2+ hours advance)
- Confirmation email sent with reservation ID
- Restaurant has ample notice for special arrangements

Scenario 2: Friday Night Rush
- 10 reservations at 7:00 PM (all tables full)
- 11th customer tries to book 7:30 PM
- System rejects: "All tables occupied around 7:30 PM"
- Suggests booking 9:00 PM (2+ hours after 7:00 PM)

Scenario 3: Last-Minute Online Order
- Customer wants delivery NOW
- System rejects: "Advance booking required. Book at least 2 hours ahead"
- Customer books for 2 hours later
- Restaurant receives order with structured address + Maps link

Scenario 4: Corporate Lunch (Takeaway)
- Office orders 20 items for pickup at 1:00 PM
- Books at 11:00 AM (2 hours advance)
- No table capacity check (takeaway doesn't use tables)
- Kitchen gets 2-hour prep time
